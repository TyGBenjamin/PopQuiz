# PopQuiz

## Description

To help get familiarized with certain CSS techniques a timed-quiz application was built allowing users to answer multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface while using no Bootstrap or similar appliaction. Each user's score and name can be logged as well upon successful completion of the quiz.
