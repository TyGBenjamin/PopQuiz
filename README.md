# PopQuiz

Constructed a Multiple choice quiz from scratch. No HTML, CSS, or Javascript provided. We also were instructed not to use bootstrap elements 
to ensure we can properly structure HTMl without assitance of Third Party.

For this Assignment the acceptance criteria is as follows

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score


I was able to successfully get the expected output based on the criteria above. Esthetically, my page can use some work on improving design and style. Nonetheless, the functionality is solid and meets the requirements.
